These are all individual scripts to perform simple repetitive tasks that I'm too lazy to do myself.

**AbundantTaxa.py**: Accepts an ASV feature table as an argument and returns a results.csv that tells you the most abundant ASV/Taxa in each sample.

**add_beginning.sh**: This script adds some default SBATCH commands to the start of a different .sh script.

**ComplementStrands.py**: A terminal interface program that will accept a DNA strand and figure out the complementary and reverse strands for you. It even handles ambiguous nucleotide codes.

**random_R.R**: An R script for when I need to run something small that I'll never run again. Changes frequently.
